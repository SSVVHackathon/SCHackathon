Our website, Food Where It Should Be falls under the health category for this hackathon.

We created a django website which allow restaurants to enter our databases meaning they have extra food left over at night.  The would simply create an account and every time they have extra food, they would login to give their address and company name.  From here, shelters, and food banks can easily check for the nearest restaurants willing to give food left over.  The shelters can come pick up the food and feed the hungry in their shelters or at any location.  Our main goal is to ensure that restaurants are not throwing away food that is left-over at the end of the day.  Too many people in the U.S. sleep hungry for this to happen.  With Food Where It Should Be, we will lower the number of people hungry in America.
